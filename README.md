GAME RULES:

Hangman's Twist is a competitive, two-player twist on the classic hangman game. This is a turn-based showdown where both players race to solve the hidden word and claim victory!

* Hangman's Twist is a two-player, turn-based game. Players take turns guessing, trying to uncover the hidden word first to win.
Levels of Play:

* Level 1: Players may only guess consonants. Each correct consonant fills in parts of the word. Once all consonants are guessed, the game advances to Level 2.
* Level 2: In this level, players can no longer guess individual letters. Instead, they must attempt to guess the entire word. The first player to correctly guess the word wins the game!

* The executioner will allow you both, 12 combined "lives" before he loses his patience and hangs the man. Each incorrect guess by either player reduces the shared lives by one.
If the shared lives reach zero before anyone correctly guesses the word, the game ends in a loss for both players.
Winning the Game:

* The first player to guess the complete word correctly in Level 2 wins the game.
If lives run out before the word is guessed, the game ends, and both players lose.
So, choose your guesses carefully, watch your opponent’s moves, and aim to be the first to figure out the word. Will you emerge victorious, or will both of you face defeat?

Good luck, and may the best guesser win!
